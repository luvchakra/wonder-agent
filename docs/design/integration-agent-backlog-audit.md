## 2026-09-14 — INTEGRATION-P0-01 through P0-04 (initial implementation)

**Agent:** Integration Agent · **Branch:** `claude/wonderagent-setup-lasmly` (same
environment-pinned-branch deviation Foundation/Identity recorded).

**Built — full P0 backlog in one pass:**

- **INTEGRATION-P0-01.1** — `ConnectorAdapter` interface
  (`modules/integrations/connector.ts`) with every import* method returning
  `{ externalId, raw, normalized? }` — `normalized` is populated directly by
  connectors that know their source API's shape natively (Saviynt), and left
  undefined by config-driven connectors (Generic REST) for the sync executor
  to fill in via stored field mappings. This one adjustment to the backlog's
  literal method signatures (`Promise<NormalizedX[]>` → `Promise<ImportedRecord<NormalizedX>[]>`)
  was necessary to let both connector styles share one sync path without
  Generic REST faking a mapping engine internally; flagging it here since it
  changes the interface shape the backlog sketched, even though the
  capability-declaration mechanism itself is unchanged.
- **INTEGRATION-P0-01.2 (higher bar)** — `integration_types` (seeded: saviynt,
  generic_rest, mcp, webhook), `integrations`, and `integration_credentials`
  (migrations `0019`-`0021`). `integration_credentials` grants **no** RLS
  policy at all — same treatment as Foundation's `platform_admins` — reachable
  only via `supabaseServiceRole()` from this module's own credential/connector
  code. Verified directly (see below) that the encrypted secret is
  unreachable via the client even for the owning tenant, and
  `GET /api/v1/integrations/:id` returns only a `hasCredentials` boolean,
  never a credential field.
- **INTEGRATION-P0-01.3** — `integration_sync_jobs` (migration `0022`).
  Client-facing INSERT is allowed but its `WITH CHECK` pins every result
  field to its just-created default (`status = 'queued'`, counts at 0, no
  timestamps) — closing a loophole a bare tenant check would leave open,
  where a client could otherwise INSERT a row already claiming
  `status = 'succeeded'` with fabricated counts. Only the trusted sync
  executor (`modules/integrations/syncJobs.ts`, via
  `supabaseServiceRole()`) may update a job afterward. Verified live: a
  same-tenant attempt to insert a job pre-set to `'succeeded'` was rejected
  by this `WITH CHECK`, not merely filtered.
- **INTEGRATION-P0-01.4** — `integration_objects` (migration `0023`, no
  client write policy at all — imported data is never hand-typed) and
  `integration_mappings` (migration `0024`, client-facing CRUD scoped via a
  join to `integrations.tenant_id`, since the table has no `tenant_id` column
  of its own per its schema in the backlog).
- **INTEGRATION-P0-02.1** — `SaviyntConnector`
  (`modules/integrations/connectors/saviynt.ts`), READ-ONLY (no
  `createAccessRequest`/`removeAccess`/`importActivity` capability, per P0
  scope). **Flagged, not silently assumed**: this sandbox has no live
  Saviynt tenant to test against, so the connector's endpoint paths
  (`/ECM/api/v5/...`) and field names (`accountname`, `entitlementname`,
  etc.) are built from Saviynt's commonly documented REST API conventions,
  not verified against a real deployment — confirm and adjust
  `config.endpoints` and the normalization functions against the actual
  customer tenant before production use. This does not block the module's
  critical acceptance test, which the backlog explicitly scopes to the
  Generic REST connector instead.
- **INTEGRATION-P0-02.2** — Sync status/health via `Integration.status`,
  `lastSyncAt`/`nextSyncAt`, and `GET /api/v1/integrations/:id/jobs` (list)
  plus `GET .../jobs/:jobId` (one). Scheduled sync (`next_sync_at`-driven) is
  not wired to an actual scheduler in P0 — only manual
  (`POST /api/v1/integrations/:id/sync`) is triggered end-to-end; the column
  and the `'scheduled'` trigger value exist for a future cron route to use.
- **INTEGRATION-P0-03.1** — `GenericRestConnector` plus the shared
  `RestHttpClient` (offset and cursor pagination, per-connector rate
  limiting, api_key/bearer/oauth2-as-bearer/basic auth; `mtls` explicitly
  rejected as not implemented in P0, per the backlog). This is the connector
  the module's critical acceptance test runs against.
- **INTEGRATION-P0-03.2** — `integration_mappings` CRUD plus
  `applyMappings()` (straight field-to-field dot-path copy, no scripted
  transforms, per the backlog's explicit DO-NOT-IMPLEMENT), and a bare
  functional mapping form on the integration detail page.
- **INTEGRATION-P0-04.1** — `McpConnector.discover()` speaks MCP's
  Streamable HTTP transport directly via a single `tools/list` JSON-RPC
  POST (no MCP client SDK dependency added). **Flagged, not silently
  guessed**: discovered tools are persisted as `integration_objects` with
  `object_type = 'entitlement'` — the closest fit among the existing
  seven-value enum for "a capability the agent may be granted" — since
  Runtime Agent's own `runtime_tools` model doesn't exist yet to confirm
  the better-fitting shape, exactly the situation the backlog said to flag
  rather than guess at silently. Tool→agent linking is **not** implemented
  here: it goes through Identity's own `linkAgentIdentity()`
  (`POST /api/v1/agents/:id/identities`, `identityType: 'mcp_server'`),
  which already exists — building a second link mutation in this module
  would have duplicated a write path Identity owns exclusively per the
  ownership map, and this module's own backlog already commits to
  "consumes Identity Agent's agents list read-only; does not create/modify
  agents rows itself."
- **INTEGRATION-P0-04.2 (higher bar)** — `POST /api/v1/integrations/mcp/:id/events`,
  authenticated by the integration's stored shared secret as a bearer token
  (never unauthenticated). Runtime Agent doesn't exist yet, so normalized
  events are buffered in `integration_objects` (`object_type = 'activity'`)
  rather than a `runtime_events` table that doesn't exist — the hand-off
  contract is explicitly pending, per the backlog's own instruction.
- **INTEGRATION-P0-04.3** — `POST /api/v1/integrations/webhooks/:id`, HMAC-SHA256
  over the exact raw request body (read via `request.text()`, never
  re-serialized JSON, so the signature is checked against the actual signed
  bytes), timing-safe comparison, using the same shared-secret mechanism as
  MCP events. A missing or invalid signature is rejected and never
  persisted — verified both by unit test (`webhooks.test.ts`) and live
  end-to-end (curl against a running server, see below).

**Verification run:**
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test` (26/26 passing across 6
  files — new: `mappings.test.ts` for `applyMappings()`'s dot-path
  resolution, `webhooks.test.ts` for HMAC accept/reject/tamper/malformed
  cases, `restHttpClient.test.ts` for offset pagination, cursor pagination,
  nested `dataPath` extraction, auth-header construction, and failure
  propagation), `npm run build` — all clean.
- Live smoke test against a locally started production server: unauthenticated
  hits to the webhook and MCP-event endpoints correctly return 401 with a
  clear rejection reason and never crash; **a real bug was caught and fixed
  this way** — `/integrations`, `/integrations/new`, and `/integrations/[id]`
  initially let an unauthenticated `ApiError` propagate out of the page
  component uncaught, producing a raw 500 instead of Identity's established
  redirect-to-sign-in pattern. Fixed to match that precedent; re-verified
  all three now return a 307 to `/sign-in`.
- Tenant isolation and credential-secrecy proof executed directly against the
  live dev Supabase project via the Supabase MCP `execute_sql` tool (same
  methodology as Foundation/Identity, for the same network-egress reason).
  Fixture: two tenants, one full integration graph each (integration +
  credential + sync job + object + mapping). Acting as Tenant A's user: every
  table returned only Tenant A's own rows; a same-tenant `SELECT` against
  `integration_credentials` returned **zero rows** (it has no policy at all,
  not even for the owning tenant); a same-tenant `INSERT` into
  `integration_objects` claiming a forged import was rejected; a same-tenant
  `INSERT` into `integration_sync_jobs` pre-set to `status = 'succeeded'`
  was rejected by the `WITH CHECK`; a cross-tenant `integration_mappings`
  insert (claiming Tenant B's `integration_id`) was rejected by the
  join-based policy; a cross-tenant `UPDATE` affected 0 rows. Fixture data
  deleted afterward; script committed at
  `tests/integration/tenant-isolation.sql`. `get_advisors` (security and
  performance) clean beyond the same previously-reviewed exceptions
  Foundation/Identity already accepted.

**Not started this session:** nothing in the P0 backlog was skipped — every
story has at least a `Done` or `Partial` entry in the Progress Tracker above.
Scheduled (cron-driven) sync execution is the one sub-piece left unwired (the
data model supports it; nothing invokes it yet) — noted under
INTEGRATION-P0-02.2 above rather than claimed as fully done.

**Dependencies consumed:** Foundation's `requirePermission()`, `writeAudit()`,
`encryptSecret()`/`decryptSecret()`, `supabaseServer()`/`supabaseServiceRole()`
— all used exactly as published, no modification to any Foundation file.
Identity Agent's `agents` domain is referenced only in documentation (the MCP
tool-linking note above) — no code in this module imports from
`modules/agent-identity/*`, since the actual linking UI lives on Identity's
own pages.

**Published this session, for Access/Runtime/Risk/Experience to consume once
dispatched:** `modules/integrations/service.ts` (barrel) and
`lib/shared/types/integrations.ts`. Most relevant to near-term dependents:
`getNormalizedObjects(tenantId, integrationId, objectType)` is the only
sanctioned way to read imported data (Access Agent will need this for
effective-access computation from Saviynt/Generic-REST imports), and the
MCP-event/webhook ingestion paths are the eventual feed for Runtime Agent's
`runtime_events` once that module exists and publishes a real hand-off
contract — until then, ingested activity sits in `integration_objects`
(`object_type = 'activity'`) as documented above.
